 Q1. Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django?  

# ANSWER:
 Django is a popular web development framework written in Python. It is known for its "batteries-included" philosophy, which means it comes with many built-in features and tools that help developers build robust web applications quickly and efficiently. Here are some key reasons to use Django:

Rapid Development:
Django's built-in features, such as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), authentication system, and admin interface, allow for rapid development and prototyping.

Security: 
Django includes many security features by default, such as protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This helps developers build secure applications more easily.

Scalability: 
Django is designed to handle high-traffic sites and scale effectively. Many large-scale applications use Django due to its ability to manage heavy loads.

Versatility: 
Django is suitable for a wide range of applications, from content management systems and e-commerce sites to social networks and scientific computing platforms.

Community and Documentation: 
Django has a large, active community and extensive documentation, making it easier to find solutions to problems and learn best practices.
