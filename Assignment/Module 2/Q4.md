# How memory is managed in Python?

Answer:
Memory management in python is handled by python’s built-in memory management system.

Here are the key components and concepts:

1.Reference Counting: Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of the number of references to each object in memory. When an object’s referenced count drops to zero, the memory occupied by the object is automatically deallocated.

2.Garbage Collection: Python also has a garbage collector for reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. This is particularly useful for handling reference cycles.

3.Memory Allocators: Python uses different allocators for different types of objects. For instance, small objects are managed using pymalloc, a specialized allocator for small objects, while larger objects use the system’s malloc.

4.Dynamic Typing: Python’s dynamic typing system means that objects are created dynamically, and memory is allocated at runtime. This flexibility comes at the cost of more complex memory management.
