# How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class.

ANSWER:

To define a class, use the class keyword followed by the class name and a colon.
self allows you to access and modify attributes and call methods within that instance.

EX.
class test:
    a=10
    b=20

    def printdata(self):
        print('sum of a+b is :',self.a+self.b)

result=test()

result.printdata()

# OUTPUT: Sum of a+b is: 30
