# What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?

ANSWER:

In object-oriented programming (OOP), instantiation refers to the process of creating an instance of a class. When you instantiate a class, you create an actual object in memory based on the class blueprint. This object (or instance) can then be used to access the classâ€™s attributes (variables) and methods (functions).
